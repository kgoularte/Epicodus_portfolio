        <p>Programming bootcamps were something that I have known about for a year or two but didn't orginally look into. I went to an alternative highschool that was set up as a go at your own pace structure that allowed me to graduate a year and a half early. It wasn't uncommon at my school to graduate a semester early or even a year early but a year and a half was actually a new record me and my good friend set. I went on to attend the local college in my hometown the following fall. I started out taking more than full time class load and was doing very well. over the next two years this started to change. I started to really have issues with my school and realized that I didn't do well with the traditional way of learning, like most people, and I was ready to try something new.</p>
        <p> I had heard about code schools awhile  back but a lot of the time they have a pretty bad stigma around them. when going the untraditional route there is almost always a higher risk of failure. But I really didn't want to wait three more years to get a degree so I started looking into programming bootcamps and found Epicodus. after some time I decide to come to a workshop and got the chance to see what a good program it is and two months later here I am! I am not actually from Portland and I moved to Vancouver the weekend before class started. Not only is everything at epicodus new to me but really everything in my life is right now.</p>

        <h2 class="bg">Interests</h2>
        <p>I would say that I am a person of many interest.<strong> My top interest and the one I partake in most often would have to be hiking and exploring,</strong> I know it's Oregon and that is what most people here say or so I though. So far a lot of people I have spoken with in the city do not always feel this way. Oregon is truly beautiful and I am blessed to call it home! Over the last two years I would say that I have begun to explore a lot more and I love every second of it. Last year I averaged about 20+ waterfall adventures alone along with plenty of other exploring.</p>
        <ol class="list-unstyled"><h4 class="bg"> Other Interests Include:</h4>
          <li>Videography & Photography</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Simple Living</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>I am very interested in desgin and architecture, always have been.</strong> My grandmother helped to design  schools as a career and always had a passion for design. As a child I spent a lot of time with my grandmother and I guess this is where the interest began to grow. All through high school I took design oreientated classes, well the only two that my school offered at least. Then in college I contined to do so and my minor was set as graphic desgin.</p>

        <h2 class="bg">Most Important Things to Me</h2>
        <p>I am one of those people who believe family and happiness are truly the two most important things in life! My family has always been very close and supportive of eachother. In the last year I have added a new member to the family, my puppy named Ruger. Ruger was a gift i received, after lots of persistence. Ruger has very quickly become the biggest priority in my life! Ruger is a blue heeler, austrilain shepard, and lab mix/mutt. He is my best friend, my baby boy, and my emotional support companion. He is full of life, love, and never fails to bright my mood. Ruger is my favorite being to explore with and shares a passion for the outdoors with me. Currently where I am living I am unable to have him here with me. Prior to this we have only ever spent one night apart. It is really not ideal but it is all I could manage in ths time frame. This is really the only time I have ever been away from him and it may be the hardest thing I have ever done.</P>
