          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>As the case with most anybody there is a lot of background for each person and this only continues to grow with age. let me give you a brief breakdown. I am the youngest of three children and was always consider to be the "good child". I was no angel but in comparision to my older siblings i wasn't half as wild as a teenager. as a teenager I had this drive and work ethic that put me ahead of the tradtional timeline.</p>

            <h2>What Brought me to Epicodus</h2>
            <p>Well this is somewhat of long idea for me. I went to an alternative highschool that was a go at your own pace structure that allowed me to graduate a year and a half early. it wasn't uncommon at my school to graduate a semister early or even a year early but a year and a half was actually a new record me and my friend set. don't get my wrong I love learning but it didn't seem like highschool had much to offer. I went on to start the college in my hometown the following fall. I started out taking more than full time about of classes and was doing very well. over the next two years this started to change. I started to really have issues with my school and realized that I didn't do well with the tradtional way of learning, like most people.</p>
            <p> So I had heard about code schools awhile  back but a lot of the time they have a pretty bad stimga around them. when going the untradtional route there is almost always a higher risk of failure. But I really didn't want to wait three more years to get a degree so i started looking into programming bootcamps and found epicodus. after some time i decide to come to a workshop and saw what a good program it really is and two months later here I am! I am not actaully from Portland and moved to Vancouver the weekend before class started. Not only is everything at epicodus new to me but really everything in my life is right now.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>I would say that I am a person of many interest. the intererst I enjoy the most and do the most often would have to be hiking and exploring, I know it's Oregon thats what most people here say or so I though. I really thought most people in Oregon loved the outdoors but so far in portland the people I have spoke to do not always feel this way. Oregon is truly beautiful and I am blessed to call it home! over the last two years I would say that I have begun to explore a lot more and I love every second of it. Last year I averaged about 20+ waterfall alone and lots of other trips as well.</p>
          <p>I am also very interested in desgin and archeticture. my grandmother helped to design  schools when i was a young child and always had a passion for design. as a child i spent a lot of time with my grandmother and i believe this interest corrilated over to me. all through high school i took design oreientated classes, well the only two that my school offered at least. then in college i contined to do so and my minor was set as graphic desgin.</p>

          <h2>Most Important Things to Me</h2>
          <p>I am one of those people who believe family and happiness are truly the two most important things in life! I am very close with my family and they are my back bone when it comes to a lot of things in life. In the last year I have gotten a puppy named Ruger as a gift, after lots of constant begging. Ruger has very quickly become the biggest priority in my life! Ruger is a blue heeler, austrilain shepard, and lab mix/mutt. He is my best friend, my baby boy and my emotional support companion. He is full of life, love, and never fails to bright my mood. Ruger is my favorite being to explore with and shares a passion for the outdoors with me. Currently where I am living I am unable to have him here with me. Prior to this we have only ever spent one night apart. It is really not ideal but it is all I could manage in ths time frame. This is really the only time I have ever been away from him and it may be the hardest thing I have ever done.</P>
